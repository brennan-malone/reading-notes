# practice in the terminal

## summary of readings

The Command Line - What is it, how does it work and how do I get to one.

You can open the terminal on linux (ubuntu is what I am using) by simply right clicking the background and open a new terminal. This opens the bash shell and is the start to the terminal and now that it is open we can perform many operations.

Basic Navigation - An introduction to the Linux directory system and how to get around it.

pwd is a great way to understand where in the file directory you are at. Tilde is the home directory ~ path. CD allows a user to move around the directory. Ls will list the contents of the directory.

More About Files - Find out some interesting characteristics of files and directories in a Linux environment.

linux only considers what is actually inside the file and not what the extension is. Linux is case sensitive. Escape characters work in linux commands the escape character is the `\`. Ls -a will show the contents of a file including hidden files. Everything is a file under Linux.

Manual Pages - Learn how to make the most of the Linux commands you are learning.

man then `<command>` will look up a man page for a particular command. man -k `<search term>` will look for a specific search term. n will move to the next found item. Man pages allow you to easily look information up.

File Manipulation - How to make, remove, rename, copy and move files and directories.

mkdir creates a directory. rmdir deletes a directory. touch creates a blank file. cp copy a file or directory. mv move a file or directory. rm delete a file.
