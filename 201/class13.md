# Read: 13 - Local Storage

## How to use local storage on website

1. Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?
   * It works as a good way to store a state of the web interface without requiring the user to sign up with the backend server.
2. What information should not be stored in local storage?
   * sensitive information such as PII and Passwords.
3. Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?
   * strings. you would need to convert it using `JSON.stringify` in order to store it local as a string.

## Things I want to learn more about

* they mention AJAX in the article and how it can be better than JSON for accessing APIs I am very interested in what this means and how this impacts us as web developers.
