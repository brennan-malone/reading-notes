# Read: 10 - Debugging

## Troubleshooting JavaScript

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
   * Some key difference between syntax error and logic errors is what the core cause is
   * syntax errors are often from spelling errors that throw certain error codes
   * Logic erros are when the syntax is correct but the code does not run correctly
2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
   * I ran into an error where the totals were not calculating properly after I called my event handler. This was due to the function not actually running again, just simply moving the row. Once I called the function again I was able to resotre the error. I also had an issue with sequencing through my nested for loops console log definitly helped resolve that one to see what was at each step of the for loop
3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
   * Debugging is a extremely critical element to any good developer and I consider it my absolute top priority. I think a vast major of development stems around debugging.

## Introduction to events

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?3
   * It is a way to break down the code piece by piece and run it one at a time and allow for troubleshooting. If it just runs through the whole thing and has an error that is not helpful. It is like saying my car won't start. The debugging tools help us find out why.
2. Define what a breakpoint is.
   * A break point the JavaScript will stop running and allow you to examine what values are assigned
3. What is the call stack?
   * Every time a function is called in a script it is added to the call stack and it starts running through that function until another function is called and that moves to the top of the call stack

## Things I want to know more about

The debugger console and its use in action. The console has already been so helpful I am excited to see how this can help.
