## Using Images in HTML

1. What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?
   * In cases where the image cannot be seen/displayed or takes a long time to render. It is especially important for screen readers
2. How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?
   * Don't use a title
   * Include alt text that helps describe an image to someone who cannot see it
3. Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document
   * to provide a semantic element that allows for a caption on an image. It wraps the image and figcaption within one element helping screen readers
   * it also does not have to be an image, can be any element where a caption can be useful
4. Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.
   * The difference is that an SVG is like a math formula and a gif is more akin to the answer to a math problem. The gif is already captured and created it uses an efficient math formula.
   * The SVG is the formula itself and therefore can be modified to get any answer you want without having any issues (distortion)
5. What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?
   * It would depend on whether I was trying to use loseless or lossy style of image. Being a screenshot most likely loseless to keep the text clear. I would go with PNG due to compatability and performance. JPEG if compression is not a concern.

## Using Color in CSS

1. Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.
   * The difference between background and foreground colors is the presentation. Foreground will show the color first and foremost.
   * It will take precedence over the background. Background will only appear if there is no foreground color to display. Much in the same way you see color on a plate.
   * If you put some Mac N Cheese on a plate you will see yellow first not the white underneath. Only where there is no noodles will you see the white or background color.
2. Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?
   * I would take two steps. 1. use color theory to define a nice color palette for his website
   * \2. I would make sure that the colors choosen allow for people with color blindness to still see the options.
3. What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?
   * Always consider compatability
   * Also consider Serif vs. Sans Serif for proper textual representation.
   * Consider if the font helps display the content or is it distracting?
4. What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?
   * modify the display properties of those HTML text elements
5. Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.
   * `letter spacing` and `word spacing`
