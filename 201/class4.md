   * inside a \<a> or anchor tag.
2. The href attribute contains what information?

## Functions Reusable Blocks of Code

   * function declaration is the process of creating a function needs to be done before invocation
2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
   * argument are specified when the function is invoked ex. myFunc(someArgument)
   * a parameter is when the function is declared ex. function myFunc(parameter) <- beginning of the declaration

## Piar Programming

1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey
   * Engaged collaboration had to be one of the major benefits for myself. As a very distracted person the engagement that comes from working with others will help me stay tuned into coding and making sure the code is correct.
   * The other benefit I think is key for me would be learning from fellow students. Fellow students come from all different backgrounds and have so many different ways to look at the same problem. I am always amazed at what collaboration can accomplish. I think that will be extremly helpful for me
