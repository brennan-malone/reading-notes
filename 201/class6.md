# Read: 06 - Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

## JavaScript Object Basics

1. How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?
   * I would describe an object as simply a collection of items, almost like a cardboard box. They come in different sizes and can contain many different things.
2. What are some advantages to creating object literals?
   * The advantage is when you want to send or collect some structred, related data items. Say traversing to or from a server.
3. How do objects differ from arrays?
   * arrays index the data points, but objects allow for mapping to named values. This allows for more flexibility and additional readability.
4. Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.
   * If an object property name is held in a variable, you cannot use dot notation, but can use bracket notation.
5. Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?
   * this is a keyword that refers to the current object that the code is being written inside. The advantage is when there is multiple object and allows you to reuse the same method definition for each object.

## Intro to the DOM

1. What is the DOM?
   * The DOM represents a webpage in a document structure, style, and content. It allows programming language to interact with the page because the document is a collection of nodes and objects.
2. Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.
   * JavaScript is the programming language that uses the DOM to manipulate webpages. Otherwise JavaScript would not be able to understand the component parts of a webpage.

## Things I want to know more about

This keyword always gets my mind in knots. I would love some more practice with it.
