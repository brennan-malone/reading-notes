# Read: 07 - Object-Oriented Programming HTML Tables

## Domain Modeling

1. Explain why we need domain modeling.
   * We need domain modeling because it the conceptual model for a specific problem. Done correclty it can link together the business and technical apsects of a problem and contribute to quality code.

## HTML Table Basics

1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
   * It reduces the accessibility for visually impaired users.
   * Tablkes will produce tag soup and complex markup structures
   * Tables are not auto responsive and are much more difficult to maintain
2. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML \<table>.
   * th which stands for table head
   * tr which stands for a table row
   * td which stands for table data and can be considered an item in a column

## Introducing Constructors

1. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
   * A constructor is a why to define the "shape" of an object and allow us to easily recreate similar objects.
2. How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?
   * when used in an object literal, it refers to the name of the object which is not very useful, but in a constructor is refers to any name of an object that has been created. So it becomes quite useful.

## Object Prototypes Using a Constructor

1. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
   * If me and a co-worker did not have the same boss (prototype) we would not be able to share different work methods. Instead we would have to use our own. With the same boss (prototype) we can share work methods and save time and memory by using the others work methods.
