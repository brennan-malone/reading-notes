# Phsychological safety

1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?
   * The team treating each other with respect and generally being nice
   * Equal communication between all memebers of the team
   * Sensitivity towards colleagues
2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.
   * I have been on teams in the Air Force where individuals did not talk or really contribute to the team in ways that they could have. I felt that our team could have performed much better if they were invloved and participated in the discussion
3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?
   * The perform better and the group is greater than the sum of the individuals, as the study says you can take average individuals and if they are psychologically safe then they can perform even higher than a disfunctional but individually talented team.
