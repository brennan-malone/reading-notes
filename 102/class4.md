# Read: 04 - Structure web pages with HTML

This is ciritical material, because as we build our HTML sites we will need to reference
documentation that assists in building and creating the structure of
our HTML sites.

## Wireframe and design

* used by UX designers
* good way to understand position and user interaction
* lets the designer plan without the distractions of a HTML COnfiguration
* paper vs. software depends on the use of the wireframe and what stage of design
* different tools

* Pen and paper
* UXPin
* InVsion
* Wreframe.cc

* define use cases and personas
* "user flows" are how and where to direct a user
* don't drown in the details
* add detail and start to refine the "user flow"

Three principles to good wireframes

1. clarity
2. Confidence
3. Simplicity

## Mozilla HTML Basics

* HTML just structures content it is a way to mark content a certain way
* HTML will contain tags and that tells the browser to render content a certain way

Main parts of an element are

1. opening tag
2. closing tag
3. the content
4. the element

void elements have not content and therefore no closing tag

some HTML elements are

* h1
* img
* p
* div
* ul
* li
* a

## Semantics

* good idea to use the right HTML elements for the job due to semantic value
* HTML should be coded to represent the data, not for the default styling
* Helps with SEO influence

some semantic elements

* \<article\>
* \<aside\>
* \<details\>
* \<figcaption\>
* \<figure\>
* \<footer\>
* \<header\>
* \<main\>
* \<mark\>
* \<nav\>
* \<section\>
* \<summary\>
* \<time\>
