This topic relates to what we have been studying because it is documentation github pages and markdown exactly what we have been using for lab 1.

## Markdown Basic Syntax  

\# = heading  
\= and \- can be used for alternate syntax  
\# should have a space  
put a blank line before heading  
  
use blank line to make paragraph  
don't use tabs in from of paragraph  

or hitting return after two spaces will create a second line  
\_\_ or \*\* will make something bold  
\_ or \* will italicize text  
\*\*\* or \_\_\_ will do both
  
using a \> makes a block quote

\>  
\>  
\>  
makes quote with multiple paragraphs  
\>\> will make a nested quote  
blockquotes can contain other elements  
try to put a blank line before

Unordered lists use a dash \-
