# Read: 06 - Dynamic web pages with JavaScript

## JS Intro Paragraph

* Javascript is a interpreted programming language.
* most know for scripting language for the web
* JavaScript and Java are very different

[link to JavaScript tutorials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

## Intro to Javascript - basic output

* Javascript would include some HTML code in the webpage
* that JavaScript code would run in browser and is called client side
* People have started putting it on the server side most popular is Node.js

Javascript basic output

1. The language itself
2. The DOM API
3. The Server API

* Any text editor can be used
* Embed or include javascript code directly inside the HTML file or put a line in the HTML that will include that external JavaScript file
* Input and Output
* there are a numbers of way to use output in javascript
* document.write("\<tag>something<\tag>")
* console.log("string")

## JavaScript input with prompt and confirm

* can use input via prompt

### EXAMPLE

* var name = prompt("Your name:", "")

* confirm will pop use with a yes or no question
* if (confirm("Shall I print something?")){  
    document.write("Hello World");  
}  
* will return true or false and use an if else setup in order to handle the question

## Variables

* four ways to declare a variable

1. var
2. let
3. const
4. nothing

### EXAMPLE Variable declarations

* let x = 5
* var x = 5
* const x = 5

* all Javascript variables must have unique names
* these names are called identifiers

#### Rules for Identifiers

he general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

* Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
* Names must begin with a letter.
* Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
* Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
* Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.

* = is the assignment operator the == is the equals to operator
* one statement can contain multiple variable declarations
* if you re-declare a javascript variable with var it will not lose its value
* let and const will not allow for a re-declaration
* can perform arithmetic with javascript variables using operators like = and +
* Javascript treats the dollar sign as a letter
* Javascript treats the underscore as a letter

## How computers work

* computers are a tool for thinking
* take input store input processing and output
* can use all kinds of different input
* computers processor is the processing stage
* tons of different kinds of outputs
* much different from the computer systems of previous generations
* electric wires and circuits
* on or off is one bit
* uses the binary number system
* all information and data is stored as ones and zeros
* every input and output are combined and modify information within these ones and zeroes
* and, xor, or, not. are cicruits

## Things I want to know more about

* how do I use nothing I don't really understand that variable I have not seen it before
