## MDN Control Flow

* Controle FLow is the order which a computer executes statements in a script
* Runs first line to the last line unless a structure changes that control flow
* Control structures are loops, functions, conditionals, and events

## Functions

* block of code to perform particular task
* defined with the function key word followed by ()
* function names follow the same rules as variables
* the parentheses my include parameters
* code to be executed is placed inside the curly brackets {}
* arguments are the values recieved by the function when it is invoked
* invoke = calling function
* can happen when event occurs, when it is invoked, or automatically
* when a return statement is reached the function will stop executing and will often have a return value
* functions are used for re-using code
* can use a function as a variable value
* variables in a function are local to that function

## Operations

### There are different types of JavaScript operators

* Arithmetic Operators
* Assignment Operators
* Comparison Operators
* Logical Operators
* Conditional Operators
* Type Operators

### Arithemtic Operators

* \+ addition
* \- subtraction
* \* multiplication
* \** exponentiation
* \/ division
* \% modulus
* ++ increment
* -- decrement

### Assignment Operators

* =
* +=
* -=
* *=
* /=
* %=

### Comparision Operators

* == equal to
* === equal value and equal type
* != not equal
* !== not equal value or not equal type
* \> greater than
* < less than
* \>= greater than or equal to
* <= less than or equal to
* ? ternary operator

### Logical Operators

* && logical and
* || logical or
* ! logical not

### Conditional Operators

* typeof Returns the type of a variable
* instanceof Returns true if an object is an instance of an object type

### Type Operators

* & AND
* | OR
* ~ NOT
* ^ XOR
* << left shift
* \>> right shift
* \>>> unsigned right shift

## Expressions

[link to MDN expressions and operators page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators)

* this link gives great examples of these operators in use

## Functions Again

* this link gives great examples of functions in use and their nature

## Things I would Like to know more about

* would love to see an example of instanceof it seems very powerful
* ternary operators trip me up, I never know when to use them. I would like to use them in practice some more
