# Read: 02 - The Coder's Computer

This is relevant as we have install vscode for a text editor, but in the corporate world there are so many to choose from
that it makes deciding on which one an important decision.

## Choosing a Text Editor  

* The text editor that works best for someone is simply the one that works.
* ask does it do everything that you are looking for? yes? then it was a good choice.
* A text editor simply manages text
* A key element for developers
* Code auto completion is a critical feature of any text editor  
the difference between a basic text editor vs. a coding-specific text editor vs. an IDE is  
all about the features that are included within that environment  
Often times a basic editor does not contain any features to "assist" in wiritng code  
Just plain text and you have to put it in correctly because it won't warn you  
that is one side of the chart then an IDE is the other allowing for the most features  
for a specific coding environemnt even in some cases allowing to compile code together
for languages that have that option. An IDE is truly an all in one package for a coding language.  

## The Command Line  

* Right click the desktop 'open in terminal'
* Bash... (we are using zsh)

## Basic Navigation  

* PWD (print working directory)
* ls (list)
* cd \[location\]  

## About Files  

* file (obtains info about what type of file a file or directory is)
* ls -a (list but with hidden files)

## Things I want to know more about
I want to learn more about how to use git commands to push and pull repos from github using the terminal.  
I know we will go over it. I am just excited for it.
