Hi my name's Brennan and I love learning! ‚ù§Ô∏è

What does a Growth Mindset mean to me?  <br>
Growth mindset is about learning! üìñ  <br>
It is about the belief that we can develop our skills further through hard work, good strategies, and input from others.

Three reminders to stay in a growth mindset:

1. __ALWAYS__ have a positive attitude, there will be roadblocks and failures.
2. Do __NOT__ compare yourself to others. Everyone has a different journey.
3. __ALWAYS__ Appreciate the progress that has been made. Appreciation will help foster a positive outlook!
